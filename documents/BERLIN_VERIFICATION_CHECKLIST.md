5-Hour Row:     [‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã] (3/4 lamps - 15 hours)
1-Hour Row:     [‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè] (4/4 lamps - 4 remaining hours)
5-Minute Row:   [‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè] (11/11 lamps - 55 minutes)
1-Minute Row:   [‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè] (4/4 lamps - 4 remaining minutes)

Total: 23 lamps illuminated
Binary: 111101111111111111111111
```

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] High-resolution photos of complete clock
- [ ] Close-up photos of each row
- [ ] Video of the exact 19:59:00 moment

## üèõÔ∏è PHASE 2: BENDLERBLOCK MEMORIAL INVESTIGATION

### Navigation
**From Berlin Clock to Memorial**:
- [ ] **Direction**: 26.4¬∞ from North (NNE)
- [ ] **Distance**: 156.6 meters
- [ ] **Walking time**: ~2 minutes
- [ ] **Target coordinates**: 52.506161¬∞N, 13.339930¬∞E

### Memorial Investigation Protocol
- [ ] **Locate the exact coordinates** (use GPS)
- [ ] **Search for elements related to "23"**:
  - [ ] Plaques with number 23
  - [ ] 23rd element in sequences
  - [ ] Dates involving 23
  - [ ] Architectural elements in groups of 23
- [ ] **Apply 24-bit binary pattern**:
  - [ ] Look for 24-element sequences
  - [ ] Binary representations in memorial design
  - [ ] Light patterns or architectural elements
- [ ] **Investigate 242424 connections**:
  - [ ] Dates: December 24th references
  - [ ] Times: 24:24 symbolic representations
  - [ ] Numerical sequences: 242424 patterns

### Specific Areas to Investigate
